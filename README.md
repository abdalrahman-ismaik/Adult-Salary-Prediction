# Adult-Salary-Prediction
This project, developed as part of the Data Science and AI course in Fall 2024, utilizes a Neural Network to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on various features from the Modified Adult Salary Dataset. The project emphasizes hands-on experience with real-world data analysis, focusing on data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow: For building and training the Neural Network.
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and model evaluation.
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): For balancing the dataset.

## Project Overview
This binary classification task predicts whether an individual earns more than $50K per year. The project includes:
- Data collection and exploration.
- Handling missing values and categorical data encoding.
- Feature scaling and balancing the dataset using SMOTE.
- Building and tuning a Neural Network model.
- Evaluating model performance on training, validation, and real-time datasets.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and Compilation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation
6. Testing with Real-Time Data

## Results
- Training Accuracy: 92%
- Validation Accuracy: 82%
- Real-Time Data Accuracy: 80%
